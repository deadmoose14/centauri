# Syllabus TLDR
Below are the most important aspects of our syllabus. I've decided to provide a truncated version of the syllbas so that you may reference it on your own.

## Grading 
Scale   |   Quarter Grade
:-      |:-
A 100-90|  Formative Assesments 30%
B 89-80 |   Summative Assessments 40%
C 79-70 |   Classwork/Homework 20% 
D 69-60 |   Quarter Final 10%
F 59-0  |

* **Formative** - Quizzes, Participation.
* **Summative** - Tests, Projects.

Grading is rounded to the nearest **tenth** and will be uploadly weekly. 

## Turn in Dates/Important Days of the Week
* **In class assignments**: Are due the following day. 

* **Homework**: Let n be any given week. Homework is due on Tuesday of week n+1.
* **Wednesday**: Is reserved for quizzes[^1].

## Late Work
Late work may be submitted **if and only** if you have an excused/unexcused absence. The amount of extra time is dependent on whether or not you've been *excused*.

```plaintext
if (absence != excused)
    time = 2 days
else
    time = 5 days
``` 

## Extras
First and foremost just *try your best*. My assessment of your work is heavily biased towards *effort*. It's okay to be wrong,and it's okay to fail. That's what learning is all about.

Let me show you **by example.** 

### Correct Solution
$2x + 2 = 3$

$2x = 1$    Subtracted 2 from both sides.

$x = \frac{1}{2}$   Divided by 2. 

A correct solution provides all necessary information to tell the reader *what* you did. A solution like this receives full credit.

### Incorrect solution (Partial Credit)
$2x + 2 = 3$

### Wrong Solution (No Credit)
$2x + 2 = 3$

$x = 0$

Any solution that simply states an answer is not a solution. It's an *assertion* of an answer. You provided no sequence of instructions that helps the reader understand *what* you did. This would receive *zero* credit.

[^1]: I reserve the right to change the syllabus, however, I will **only** make changes that benefit the student. This reservation is in place primarily for situations where I need to reschedule/postpone scheduled assignments, e.g., tests/quizzes to another day.
