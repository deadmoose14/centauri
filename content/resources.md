# Gauss' Divergence Theorem
Let $\textit{W}$ be a symmetric elementary region in space. Denote by $\delta W$ the oriented closed surface that bounds \textit{W}. Let \textbf{F} be a smooth vector field defined on \textit{W}. Then:

$$\iiint_{W}^{} (\Delta \cdot \textbf{F}) dV = \iint_{\partial W}^{} \textbf{F} \cdot dS.$$
