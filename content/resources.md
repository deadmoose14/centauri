# Gauss' Divergence Theorem
Let $\textit{W}$ be a symmetric elementary region in space. Denote by $\delta W$ the oriented closed surface that bounds \textit{W}. Let \textbf{F} be a smooth vector field defined on \textit{W}. Then:

$$\iiint_{W}^{} (\Delta \cdot \textbf{F}) dV = \iint_{\partial W}^{} \textbf{F} \cdot dS.$$

Test:

$$
int_{0}{3\pi} sin(x) dx

= -cos(x) |_{0}^{3\pi}

=> -cos(0) - [-cos(3)] 

= -1 + cos(3\pi)

= -1 + 0 = -1
$$
