# Equations and Expressions. What's the difference? 
A huge component of mathematics is vocabulary. A part of mathematics is understanding the language in which we speak. A common error is to conflate equations with expressions. They are NOT the same thing. Before we define equations and expressions we're going to define a **relation**. 

**Def:**
> A relation is an operation that compares two values. 

You've already been exposed to relations, however, it may not have been described to you this way. Examples of relations are $<$, $>$, and equality $=$. 

**Def:**
> An equation is a relation that states two things are **equal** to each other.

Let $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ then we can say thay are equal by writing $x=y$. This is an equation since we are trying to find **equality**.


# Variables
Think of a mailbox, a dresser, a folder, what do they have in common? They **store** things. A mailbox stores mail, a dresser stores clothes, and a folder stores paper. Think of a variable as an object that **stores** something. 

In mathematics, variables are used to house information or in our case numbers. When you see something like $2x+1=5$, the **variable** $x$ stores a value that satisfies this equation. Recall, with equations we're looking for **equality**. So when we see an equation like $2x+1=5$ what we're looking for is sum number $x$ where when we plug in in to $2x+1$ we get $5$. 

We can solve this by choosing numbers at random, or by coming up with a systematic way of solving this type of equation. 

$$2x+1=5$$

$$2x=4$$

$$x=2$$ 


# Field Axioms

Let $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$

Property | Addition | Multiplication
---------|----------|----------------
Associativity|$$a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$$|$$a(bc)=(ab)c$$
Commutativity|$$a+b=b+a$$|$$ab=ba$$
Inverse|$$a+(-a)=0$$|$$a\times\frac{1}{a} = 1$$
Identity|$$a+0=a$$|$$a\times 1 = a$$

### Distribution 
$a(b+c)=ab+ac$
